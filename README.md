## Asana-clone

This repository is organized as a mono repo, which means that it has an entry point which means the client and the server are made as different projects. They are organized as workspaces, which gives me control over projects from this entry point.

To start and install all the dependencies run:

```bash
npm run init-project
```

It will install dependencies in all the workspaces

To build the whole project - run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the development process - run:

```bash
npm start
```
