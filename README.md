## Asana-clone

This repository is organised as a monorepo, which means that it has an entry point and client and server are made as different projects. They are organised as workspaces, which gives me control over projects from this entry point.

In order to start and install all the dependencies run:

```bash
npm run init-project
```

It will install dependencies in all the workspaces

To build the whole project - run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the development process - run:

```bash
npm start
```
